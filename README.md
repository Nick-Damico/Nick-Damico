## ðŸ‘‹ Nicholas D'Amico | Full-Stack Web Developer

<p>
  I am a passionate full-stack developer based in East Tennessee, with over 4 years of coding experience. What started as a hobby quickly turned into a career aspiration, as I realized my love for coding and the desire to pursue it professionally.
</p>

<p>
In 2016, I made a life-changing decision to embark on a career path aligned with my passion. I enrolled in a Techdegree program with Treehouse and successfully completed it in March 2017. This intensive program provided me with a solid foundation in web development and strengthened my skills in various technologies.
</p>

<p>
Seeking to expand my knowledge and enhance my capabilities, I made the decision to further my education at The Flatiron School. There, I immersed myself in an immersive coding program and graduated on March 14th, 2018. This experience deepened my understanding of software development and equipped me with practical skills to tackle real-world challenges.
</p>

<p>
With my combined education, hobbyist background, and professional training, I am well-prepared to contribute my expertise and passion to impactful projects.
