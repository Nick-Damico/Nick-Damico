## ðŸ–¥ Ruby On Rails | Full-Stack Web Developer

<p>
  I'm a full-stack developer based in East Tennessee, with over 4 years of professional experience. What started as a hobby quickly became a career aspiration, as I realized my enjoyment of coding and desire to pursue it professionally.
</p>

<p>
In 2016, I made a decision to embark on a career change. I enrolled in a <strong>Techdegree program with Treehouse</strong> and successfully completed it in March 2017. This intensive program provided me with a solid foundation in web development and strengthened my skills in various technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
Wanting to further my knowledge and skill with backend programming, I decided to continue my education at <strong>Flatiron Coding Bootcamp</strong>. There, I immersed myself in the coding program and graduated on March 14th, 2018. This experience deepened my understanding of software development and equipped me with skills to tackle real-world challenges.
</p>

<p>
With my combined education, hobbyist background, and professional experience, I am prepared to contribute my expertise and passion to exciting projects.
