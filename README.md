## 🖥 Ruby On Rails | Full-Stack Web Developer

<p>
  I'm a full-stack developer based in East Tennessee, with over 4 years of coding experience. What started as a hobby quickly turned into a career aspiration, as I realized my enjoyment for coding and the desire to pursue it professionally.
</p>

<p>
In 2016, I made a life-changing decision to embark on a career path aligned with my passion. I enrolled in a <strong>Techdegree program with Treehouse</strong> and successfully completed it in March 2017. This intensive program provided me with a solid foundation in web development and strengthened my skills in various technologies.
</p>

<p>
Seeking to expand my knowledge and enhance my capabilities, I made the decision to further my education at <strong>Flatiron Coding Bootcamp</strong>. There, I immersed myself in the coding program and graduated on March 14th, 2018. This experience deepened my understanding of software development and equipped me with practical skills to tackle real-world challenges.
</p>

<p>
With my combined education, hobbyist background, and professional experience, I am well-prepared to contribute my expertise and passion to impactful projects.
